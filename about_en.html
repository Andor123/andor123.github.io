    <p class="lead">My name is Andor Salamon. I was born on the 25th of August 1995 in Subotica.
        In my whole life I lived in Čantavir and right now I still live there.</p>
    <p class="lead">I went to kindergarten (2 years) and primary school (8 years) in Čantavir and
        maybe for a short period of time, the world of Informatics made an influence on me,
        everything within IT.</p>
    <p class="lead">After primary school I got to Subotica, where I went to
        middle school (4 years) and a weird thing happened to me, that I studied
        mechanics despite the fact that I didn't loved that. Fortunately, I did it.</p>
    <p class="lead">Then it was graduation, which was went for me very well. Before
        graduation I promised to myself, that for college (which was in Subotica too)
        I choose Informatics and I think that this step was crucial.</p>
    <p class="lead">Shortly after graduation I applied to the college and
        then I only dealt with Informatics. After 3 years of college it was time
        for the Diploma Thesis Defence, which I passed in Electronic Management
        and the title of the thesis was "Development and Realisation of Multiplatform
        and Multifunctional Web Page."</p>
    <p class="lead">Right now I am currently searching for a job and that is
        the reason, that on this website I attach an online CV, where I can
        give help to the employers, if they want to. I know one thing for sure:
        Money never motivate me, to get a job to myself.</p>
    <p class="lead">In conclusion just some words about myself: nice,
        a little bit modest and I can get along with everyone I think even
        in work or even personal level.</p>
